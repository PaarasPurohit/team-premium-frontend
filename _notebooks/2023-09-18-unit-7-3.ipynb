    "### Learning Objectives:\n",
    "- With an Arraylist you can traverse objects using a for or while loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Traversing objects is similar to iterating through objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Essential Knowledge:\n",
    "- Iteration statements can be used to accsess all the elements in an Arraylist. This is called traversing the Arraylist.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Deleting elements during a traversal of an Arraylist requires special techniques to avoid skiping elements. This is called traversing the Arraylist.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The indicies of an Arraylist start at 0; If you try to use any value lower than 0, you will get an *ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException* error"

    "#### Common mistakes:\n",
    "- Using the Wrong Data Type: Ensure that you declare your ArrayList with the correct data type. Using the wrong data type can lead to type mismatches and errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Incorrect Indexing: Be cautious when using a standard for loop. Off-by-one errors or accessing elements that don't exist can lead to runtime exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Modifying the List During Iteration: Modifying an ArrayList (adding or removing elements) while iterating over it can lead to a ConcurrentModificationException. To avoid this, use an Iterator or create a copy of the list if modifications are needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Not Checking for Null Elements: When using enhanced for loops or iterators, check for null elements if there's a possibility that your list contains them to avoid NullPointerExceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inefficient Searching: If you need to find a specific element, avoid using a linear search within a loop. Use appropriate methods like contains() or indexOf() to find elements efficiently."
